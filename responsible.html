<h1>Responsible Gaming</h1>

<p class="lore">
The Ivory Ledger is built on discipline, not excess.

Gaming is entertainment — not income.

We encourage all members to play within their limits,
maintain balance, and seek support if control begins to fade.

If gambling stops being enjoyable, step away.

Strength is knowing when to pause.
</p>

<p class="lore">
If you or someone you know needs support, please contact your local
responsible gambling service.
